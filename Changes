NAME
    Revision History for Algorithm::Munkres.

SYNOPSIS
    A list of changes to the Algorithm::Munkres module.

DESCRIPTION

   Version 0.08 (Algorithm::Munkres-0.08 Released on 22nd Oct 2008)
        These changes were contributed by Ken Williams (kwilliams@cpan.org):
	1. Prefer foreach(@x){...} rather than for($i=0;$i<@x;$i++){...}
	   because it tends to be faster and less verbose.
 	2. Exit early from loops when possible; this is a huge win for 
	   the find_a_zero() function in particular.
	3. Increase the minimum required version of perl to 5.006, 
	   because that's when the our() construct was introduced.
	4. Don't use a 99999999999 sentinel in find_smallest().

   Version 0.07 (Algorithm::Munkres-0.07 Released on 9th Aug 2007)
	1. Bug Fix: Added re-initialization code for global variables to the 'assign' subroutine. (Thanks to Gabriel Cardona!)
