Algorithm-Munkres version 0.01
=============================

SYNOPSIS

	Algorithm::Munkres implements Munkres' solution to classical Assignment problem

DESCRIPTION

	Assignment Problem: Given N jobs and N workers, how should be assignment of Worker-Job, 
	so as to minimize the time taken. 

	Thus if we have 3 jobs p,q,r and 3 workers x,y,z such that:
	   x  y  z		
	p  2  4  7
	q  3  9  5
	r  8  2  9

	then possible solutions are:	
			Total
	1. 2, 9, 9       20
	2. 2, 2, 5        9
	3. 3, 4, 9       16
	4. 3, 2, 7       12
	5. 8, 9, 7       24
	6. 8, 4, 5       17

	Thus (2) is the optimal solution for the above problem.
	This kind of brute-force approach of solving Assignment problem quickly becomes slow and bulky as N grows, 
	because the number of possible solution are N! and thus the task is to evaluate each and compare, to 
	find the optimal solution.(If N=10, number of possible solutions: 3628800 !)
	Munkres' gives us a solution to this problem, which is implemented in this module.
